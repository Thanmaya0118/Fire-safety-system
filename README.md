 Fire hazards pose serious risks, often resulting in severe damage
 if not detected early. Traditional fire alarm systems can be
 costly and inaccessible for smaller applications. This project
 addresses the need for an affordable and efficient solution by
 developing a fire alarm system using Arduino, integrating
 temperature and gas sensors for real-time fire detection and
 timely alerts
